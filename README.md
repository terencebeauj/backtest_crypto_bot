# backtest_crypto_bot
Using the "backtesting" framework to backtest a crypto Expert Advisor.
First, we get the data from binance.
Then we backtest the bot, and we do an optimization with a bayesian optimizer (similar to machine learning hyperoptimization)
This is only for backtesting, if you want to use this for real, I recommend to use the ccxt API (maybe you'll need to look another tuto.)
