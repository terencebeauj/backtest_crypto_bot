# backtest_crypto_bot
Using the "backtesting" framework to backtest a crypto Expert Advisor.
We backtest the bot first, then we do an optimization with a bayesian optimizer (similar to machine learning hyperoptimization)
This is only for backtesting, if you want to use this for real, I recommend to use the shrimpy API (maybe you'll need to look another tuto.)
